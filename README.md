## Clohing_store-Beginner_project
This repository contains a clothing store database project. This project was put together by a beginner in data science to practice basic SQL concepts. 
With this project, it is possible to create a simple database schema for a clothing store and practice basic **SQL** queries using **MySQL**.

### Project Overview
This project covers the following main aspects:

**Database Setup**: A script to set up a MySQL database named "Clothing_Store," which will serve as the foundation for a practice.

**Table Creation**: SQL scripts are provided to create essential tables such as "Supplier," "Product," "Order," and "Customer." These tables are designed to mimic real-world data relationships.

**Data Insertion**: Sample data has been prepared to populate the tables and make the practice more engaging.

**Query exercises**: The project contains a set of SQL queries useful in data analysis. These queries cover basic querying techniques, including selecting, filtering, sorting, and joining data.
